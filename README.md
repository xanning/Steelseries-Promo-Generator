# Broken

Ratelimits are too much and i don't know how to fix it. Proxy seems like fixing account creation ratelimit but for fetching codes i believe it's hardware based and only

lets you 4 per minute or something.

# What to do

Basics are this, with reverse engineered API. Port can be different

You can find the local API in your C:\ProgramData\SteelSeries\GG and in coreProps.json 

ggEncryptedAddress being your API

If you can, fix and use.
